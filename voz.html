            A long , long time ago , in the prosperous town of Hamelin , in Germany , something very strange happened:
            one
            morning, when its fat and satisfied inhabitants left their houses, they found the streets invaded by
            thousands
            of mice that were prowling everywhere, devouring eagerly for grain from their overflowing barns and food
            from
            their well-stocked pantries.No one was able to understand the cause of such an invasion, and what was even
            worse, no one knew what to do to put an end to such a disturbing plague of mice . As much as they tried to
            exterminate them or, at least, chase them away, it seemed that more and more mice were coming to the city.
            Such
            was the number of mice that, day after day, took over the streets and houses, that even the cats themselves
            fled
            in fear.
